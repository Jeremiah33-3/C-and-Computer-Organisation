# Computer, number system, ands so on

## Programming languages and computer organisation
> a __formal__ language that speicifies a set of __instructions__ for a computer to implement specific algorithms to __solve problems__.

Level of abstraction in descending order: 
- high-level language: level of abstraction closer to problem domain, which prodvides productivity and portability (C, JS)
- assembly lang: textual and symbolic representation of instructions (for the machine to understand), and is translated by a compiler. (for MIPS)
- Machine code: a squence of 0s and 1s, binary bits of instrustions and data for the processor to understand, change by assembler, low-level langugae (for MIPS)

Abstraction layers, hardware/software stack in the computer:
- Software stack
  - application software (cannot run directly on the computer -> needs additional software)
  - additional software is provided through the *operating system.*
    - loader, scheduler (run concurrency), device drivers
  - compiler, aseembler, linker in the computer runs to produce the application software to run on the computer -- the bridge between application software and operating system
- Hardware stack 
  - processor, memory, I/O system (CS2100)
    - underlining these 3 major parts are two important concepts of datapath & control design which apply in particular to processor (control unit)
  - digital logic design (CS2100)
  - circuit design 
  - transistors
- bridge bwtween software and hardware: instruction set architecture (ISA), 0s and 1s (CS2100)

Parts of computer in more details (hardware):
- PC Motherboard
- Intel i7 processor
  - inside the core (CPU): control unit and ALU
 
Computer organisation:
> the study of internal working, structuring and implementaion of a computer system
- refers to the level of abstraction **above the digital logic level, but below the system level.**
- why study:
  - understand optimisation better
  - make better purchasing decisions
  - build better softwares

## [von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)

An architecture that describes a computer consisting of 
1. central processing unit (CPU) with registers, control unit (containment of instruction register and program counter) and arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)
2. memory which stores both program and data in random-access memory (RAM)
   - 3 types of mem: RAM, ROM, Flash (kind of RAM but retains mem when power is switched off)
4. I/O devices (keyboard, screen...)

## Variables

> data used in the program

- var has name (identifier), data type, address, and contains a value which could be modified
- var declaration: data type and name (e.g. int count)
- var initialisation + declaration: assignment/initialised during declaration (e.g. int count = 3)
- without initialisation -> var contains an unknown value (may not be zero)
- C language mistakes: no initialisation (immediate assignment next line) and redundant initialisation (int count = 0; count = 123 or scanf("%d", &count))
- every var must be declared with data types; [list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-c/) of data types in C
  - int: 4 bytes (-21^31 to 2^31 - 1)
  - float: 4 bytes 
  - double: 8 bytes
  - char: 1 byte (enclosed in a pair of single quotes) -> char is just a 8-bit integrer in C
- note: [signed: take both positive and negative values](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/621290/what-is-the-difference-between-signed-and-unsigned-variables) 
- strongly types vs weakly typed
  - strongly: evrey var needs to be declared with a type vs weakly: type depends on how the var is used
  - other aspects: static/dynamic type checking, safe type checking, type conversions
  - implitcit type conversions [in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implicit-type-conversion-in-c-with-examples/)
  - C allows pointer values to be explicitly cast

## Data representation and Number Sytem 

Everthing is a number in C... But how are they representated as numbers? -> 0s (<1.15V) and 1s (>3.75V)

**Data Representation**
- C has basic data types: float, int,  double, char
- how data representated depends on the type (context, that's why needs to declare data type) -> the identical strings/same combination of 0s and 1s may give different meaning depending on the type
- **Data are internally represented as sequences of bits (binary digits). A bit is either 0 or 1.**
 - other units: byte, nibble (4 bits), word (multiple of bytes depending on the computer architecture; a single unit of transfer to the CPU)
- N bits can represent up to 2^N values 
- to represent M values, math.ceiling(log2M) bits required -> have to be whole number and even number (math floor will be short of one bit)

**Decimal (base 10) Number System**
- a weighted-positional number system
- base (radix) is 10
- symbols.digits = {0,1,2...9}
- each position has a weight of power of 10
- e.g. decimal is represented by negative powers of 10, thousands has a power of 10^3

**other number system**
- binary (base 2)
  - weights in powers of 2
  - binary digits
- octal (base 8)
  - weights in powers of 8
  - octal digits: 0,1,2...,7
- hexadecimal (base 16)
  - weights in powers of 16
  - hexadecimal digits: 0,1,2...,9,A,B,..,F
- base/radix R
  - weights in powers of R
- **NOTE**: in some programming languages/softwares, speicial notations are used to represent numbers in certain bases
  - C:
    - prefix 0 for octal
    - prefix 0x for hexadecimal
  - QTSpim (MIPS simulator)
    - predix 0x for hexadecimal
  - Verilog:
    - prefix 8"b, h"h, h"d
    
**Base-R to Decimal Conversion**
- subfix is important -> indicates base -> multiple each number according to the powers of R -> demical number

**Decimal to Binary Conversion**
- for whole numbers: repeated division by 2 method
  - division, divides quotient, reminded remainders
  - the remainders forn the ans, with the first remainder as the least significant bit LSB (rightmost) and last as the most significant bit MSB (leftmost)
- for fractions: repeated multiplication by 2 method
  - until fractional product is 0
  - need to substract away the carries
  - the carried digits are the answer, the first carry is the MSB, the last as the LSB
  - answer got to have a dot in front (fractions)
- **note**: for decimal to base-R we use the same technique as decimal to binary except the base changes

__in general, conversion between bases can be done via decimal(interconnection, bridge)__

**Convert binary to octal/hexadecimal**
- binary to octal: partition in groups of 3 (by binary number system)
- octal to binary: reverse
- binary to hexadecimal: partition in groups of 4
- hexadecimal to binary: reverse

**ASCII Code**
> used to represent characters (and Unicode)
- 7 bits plus 1 parity bit (odd or even parity)
- character representation of numbers is different from integer reprensatation
- if want to convert from char number to int number, subtract away 0 in character
- [ASCII](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ascii-table/) Table
- characters are represented by numbers

**Negative numbers**
- unsigned no: only non-negative values
- signed no: include all values (positive and negative)
- 3 common representations for signed binary numbers: sign-and-magnitude. 1s complement, 0s complement
- Sign and maginitude
  - the sign is represented by a sign bit -> 0 for + and 1 for -
  - one bit sign and 7 bits magnitude
  - largest value: +127 (10)
  - smalled value: -127 (10)
  - positive and negative 0s -> sign bit
  - to negate a number -> invert the sign
  - subscript sm
  - **Limitations**: not good for doing arithmetic operations
- 1s complement
  - can do arithmetic
  - given a number x which can be expressed as an n-bit binary number, its negated value can be obtained in 1s-complement representation using: -x = 2^n -x -1
  - the negation of the bits (invert)
  - largest value: +127, smallest: -127
  - 2 zeros (all 0s or all 1s)
  - definition of complements: the sum of the two numbers produce 0
  - subscript: 1s
  - the MSB still represents the sign: 0 for positive, 1 for negative
  - **Limitation**: lost 1 value on the negative side
  - **Advantage**: trivial to implement in the computer hardware 
- 2s complement
  - given a number x which can be expressed as an n-bit binary number, its negated value can be obtained in 2s-complement representation using -x= 2^n -x
  - to negate the binary no, invert all the bits then add 1 _(done in hardware too)_ OR right to left, store first 3 numbers at it is, then invert the rest of the bits
  - "2s complement of __"
  - largest value: +127, smallest value = -128
  - 1 zero only (the entire 0s)
  - the MSB still represents the sign: 0 for positive, 1 for negative
  - subscript: 2s
- comparison in 4-bit system
  - positive values remain the same for all 3 representations
  - negative values: different
    1. sign and magnitude: negate the sign bit at MSB 
    2. 1s complement: invert all bits
    3. 2s complement: 1s complement plus 1
- note: overflow positive number becomes negative number (add the bit together and see)
- we can extend the idea od complement on fractions

_Note: the weight of sign bit in 2s complement is -2^(n-1), in 1s is -2^(n-1) -1 )_

**2s complement on addition/substraction**
- Algorithm for addition of integers A + B
   1. perform binary addition on the two numbers
   2. ignore the carry out of the MSB
   3. check the overflow, overflow occurs if the carry in and carry out of the MSB are different, or is result is opposite sign of A and B
- Algo on substraction (A + (-B))
  1. take 2s complement of B
  2. add the 2s complement of B to A
- overflow ‚ùó
  - signed no are of a fixed range
  - if the result of addition/subtraction goes beyond the range, an overflow occurs
  - can be detected if positive add positive becomes negative or negative add negative becomes positive
 
**1s complement on addition/subtraction**
- algo for addition
  1. perform binary addition on the two numbers
  2. if there is a carry out of the MSB, add 1 to the result
  3. check for the overflow, overflow occurs if result is opposite sign of A and B
- algo for subtraction
  1. take 1s complement of B
  2. add the 1s complement of B to A

**excess representation**
> another way of representing negative values
- allows a range of values to be distributed evenly between the positive and negative values, by a simple translation (addition/substraction)
- usually we will do excess- 2^(n-1) where n is the number of bits

Q: how are real numbers represented in a computer system? -> finite no of bits, real no are represented in their **approximate** values.
- remember that everything needs to be stored in a real, physical, electronics, which is finite -> finite range and accuracy (cannot be stored in arbitrary accuracy)
**representation**
- fixed point representation
  - no of bits allocated for the whole no part and fractional part are fixed
  - implemented in the hardware so cannot be changed
  - **problem**: limited range
- floatin point representation
  - represent very small or very large no
  - 3 components: sign, exponent, mantissa (fraction)
**IEEE 754 FLoating point rep**
- have 3 components: sign, exponent, mantissa (fraction)
  - sign: the positive or negative (0 for positive, 1 for negative)
  - exponent: represented in a different sign number system.
    - gives the power of the representation
    - exponential power + 127 
  - mantissa: fraction part, sign applies only to mantissa (normalised with n implicit leading bit 1)
    - scienctific representation? 1.101 * 2^2
    - so that there is standard format and we can save bits (we know for sure first bit is 1) -> one additional bit of accuracy, hidden bit
- base (radix) assumed to be 2
  - two formats
    - single precision (32 bit): 1 bit sign, 8-bit exponent with bias 127 (excess-127), 23-bit mantissa 
    - double precision (64 bit): 1 bit sign, 11-bit exponent with bias 1023 (excess-1023), and 52 bit mantissa
  - we will focus on the single-precision format
- note: need to represent the number in binary
- hexadecimal representation -> binary number is more readable 

## MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)

How a processor works? (particularly MIPS)

1. Instruction set architecture

High-level -> compiler -> assembler 
> ISA: an abstraction on the interface between the hardware and the low-level interface
- software (translated to the instruction set) and hardware (implementing the instruction set)
- includes everything programmers need to know to make the machine code work correctly
- allows computer designers to talk about functions independently from the hardware that performs them
- this abstraction allows many implementations of varying cost and performance to run identical software

2. Loading large constant (32-bit constant into a register)

First, use "load upper immediate" (lui) to set the upper 16-bit 
  - lui $t0, 0xAAAA
  - t0 register ^
  - lower-order bits filled with zeros
Second, use "or immediate" (ori) to set the lower order bits
  - ori $t0, $t0, 0xF0F0
  - higher-order bits filled with zeros

3. Machine code vs assembly language
- instructions in binary vs human readable
- hard and tedious to code vs easier to write than machine code, symbolic version of machine code
- may also be written in hexadecimal for a more human-readable format vs may provide "pseudo-instructions" as syntatix sugar -> when considering performance only real instructions are counted

4.Components 

Two major components in a computer: processor and memory
processor: perform computations -> bus: bridge between the two components -> memory: storage of code and data 
- code and data reside in memory -> transferred into the processor during execution
- processor is faster than RAM (working) ->To avoid frequent access of memory
- Need instruction to move data into registers
  - Also to move data from registers to memory later
- since memory access is slow, we avoid frequent access of memory by providing temporary storage for values in the processor (known as registers)
  - moving data from memory into a register -- load
  - moving data from a register into memory -- store
  - variable mapping: loading a variable into another var (register), in assembly code when converting from c to assembly code
- reg-to-teg arithmetic
  - arithmetic operations can now work directly on registers only
  - arithmetic operation uses a constant value instead of register value
- to repeat a set of instructions/ make a chice (loop and switch, if-else)
  - control flow instruction: change the control flow based on condition
    - repetition and selection can both be supported
    - execution will repeat from the indicated position is condition succeeded
    - once condition is false, execution will continue sequentially (until we see another control flow instruction)
- Bus: data connector between mem and processor
- mem is typically simply a RAM 

Summary:
- the stored memory concept: both instructions and data are stored in memory
- the load-store model: limit memory operations and relies on registers for storage during execution
- major type of assembly instructions
  - mem: move values between memory and registers
  - calculation: arithmetic and other operations
  - control flow: change the sequential execution

General purpose registers:
- fast memories in the processor
  - data are transferred from memory to registers for faster processing
- limited in number
  - a typical architecture has 16 to 32 registers
  - compiler associates variables in program with registers [done by compiler !]
- registers have no data type
  - unlike progam variables
  - machine/assembly instruction assumes the data stored in the register is of the correct type
    - instruction: add -> store as 32 bit 2s complement; addu -> unsigned binary no.; fadd -> IEEE 754 repre (what registers store as instructed by the instruction
- 32 registers in MIPS assembly language
  - can be referred by a number ($0, $1,..., $31)
  - can be referred by a name (e.g. $a0, $t1)

MIPS Assembly Language
- each instruction executes a simple command
  - usually has a counterpart in high-level programming lang like C/C++, Java
- each line of assembly code contains at most 1 instruction
- \# (hex-sign) is used for comments (ignored by assembler)
- most of the MIPS arithmetic/logic operations have three operands: 2 sources and 1 destination + operation (op)
- arithmetic operation
  - addition
    - assume values of sources and dest are loaded into registers
    - known as variable mapping (done by compiler)
      - var-to-register mapping deals with step (1) (i.e. load) and step (3) (i.e. store). All computations are assumed to be in register for this set of instructions. 
    - actual code to perform the loading will be shown later in mem instruction
    - important: MIPS arithmetic op are mainly register-to-register (operations are register, destination also in register)
  - substraction
    - positions of sources are important for substraction (fixed)
  - complex expression
    - a single MIPS instruction can handle at most two source operands
    - so need to break a complex statement into multiple MIPS instructions (store in temp register $t0 - $t7)
    - can keep a register as dest and just add new values to it (e.g. $s4, $s0, $s1; $s4, $s4, $s2)
  - constant/immediate operands
    - immediate values are numerical constants that is frequently used in operations and MIPS supplies a set of operations specially for them
    - add immediate (addi)
      - syntax is similar to add instruction, but source2 is a constant instead of register
      - constant ranges from [-2^15 to 2^(15-1)] (16 bit 2s complement)
      - note: 1s -> [-(2^n-1 - 1) to (2^n-1 - 1)]; 2s -> [-2^n-1 to (2^n-1 - 11)]
    - no subi because can use addi with negative constant (want to have minimal number of instructions)

Register zero ($0 or $zero) 
- number zero (0), appears very often in code -> provide register zero ($0 or $zero) which always have the value 0
- for assignment (e.g. f = g)
- MIPS has an equivalent pseudo-instruction (move): move $s0, $s1 (MIPS Assembly code)
- peudo-ins are fake instructions that gets translated to corresponding MIPS instruction(s). Provided for convenience in coding only

Logical Operations 
- arithmetic instructions view the content of a register as a single quantity (signed or unsigned integer)
- new perspective
  - view register as 32 raw bits rather than as a single 32-bit number
  - possible to operate on individual bits or btyes within a word
  - shift left, shift right, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise NOR/NOT(OR), bitwise XOR
  - truth tables of logicaloperations (0 is false, 1 is true)
  - bitwise operation 
- list
  - sl (shift left logical): move all the bits ina word to the left by a number of positions; filled empited positions with zeros (sll $t2, $s0, 4)
  - srl 9shift right logical): shifts right and fills emptied positions with zeros
    - equivalent math op for shifting left/right n bits: multiplication by 2^n for left; division by 2^n for right shift
    - shifting is faster than mult/division -> good compiler translates such mult/division into shift instructions
  - and (bitwise AND): bitwise op that leaves a 1 only if both the bits of the op are 1 (and $t0, $t1, $t2)
    - also masking op (bit-mask is setting the irrelevant part to 0 i.e. masked)
    - place 0s into the positions to be ignored
    - place 1s for interested positions -> remain the same as original
    - $t2 is the mask
    - immediate version: andi
  - or (bitwise OR): bitwise op that places a 1 in the result if either op bit is 1 (or $t0, $t1, $t2)
    - immediate version: ori -> become 32-bit number
  - NOR (bitwise nor)
    - strange fact: no NOT instruction in MIPS to toggle the bits from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
    - NOR instruction is provided: nor $t0, $t1, $t2
    - NOT op: nor $t0, $t0, $zero
    - nor instruction can help perform not op, os keep the instruction set small (one of the design principles)
  - xor (bitwise XOR): xor $t0, $t1, $t2
    - get NOT op from XOR: xor $t0, $t0, $t2(all 1s)
    - fact: there is no NORI but XORI because there is not much need for NORI (keep processor design simple)
   
  **more instructions**

  Mem organisation (general) RAM:
  - main mem can be viewed as a large, single dimension array of mem locations
  - each location of the mem has an address, which is an index into the arr (given a k-bit address, the address space is of size 2^k)
  - mem map on the right contains one byte in every location/add (byte addressing)
 
  Mem: transfer unit:
  - using distinct mem address, we can access a single byte (byte addressable) or a single word (word addressable)
    - word is usually 2^n bytes
    - word is the common unit of transfer between processor and mem
    - word is also commonly coincide with the register size, the int size and instruction size in most architectures -> design simplicity
  - word alignment
    - words are aligned in mem if they begin at a byte address that is a mulyiple of the number of bytes in a word
   
MIPS Mem instruction
- MIPS is a load-store register architecture
  - 32 registers, each 32-bit (4 byte) long
    - fast processor storage for data
    - in MIPS, data must be in registers to perform arithmetic
  - each word contains 32 bit
    - 2^30 mem words ( / 2^2 since each word is 2^2 byte long)
    - accessed only by data transfer instructions
    - MIPS uses byte addresses, so consecutive words differ by 4
    - mem holds data structures, such as arrays, and spilled registers, such as those saved on procedure calls
  - memory addresses are 32-bit long
    - word address should be divided by 4 (byte address)
- Load Word
  - lw $t0, 4($s0)
  - displacement, offset = + 4
  - steps
    1. mem address = $s0 + 4 = 8000 + 4 = 8004
    2. **mem word at Mem[8004] is loaded into $t0**
- Store Word
  - sw $t0, 13($s0)
  - 8000: base addresses
  - store the word into (content copied over to the new address)
  - steps:
    1. mem address: $s0 + 12 = 8000 + 12 = 8012
    2. content of $t0 is stored into word at Mem[8012]
- only load and store instructions can access data in mem
- arithemetic op (for add) are registers, not memory
- Others
  - load bytw (lb) and store byte (sb)
  - lb $t1, 12($s3)
  - sb $t2, 13($s3)
  - similar in working except that one byte instead of one word is loaded or stored
    - offset no longer needs to be a multiple of 4
  - MIPS disallows loading.storing unaligned word using lw/sw (throw exception)
    - psedo-instructions unalighed load word(ulw) and unaligned store word (usw) are provided for this purpose
    - ulw/usw can be translated to sequene of lb/sb + other operations
  - other mem instructions
    - lh and sh (load halfword and store half)
    - lwl, lwr, swl, swr
   
Common question: 
1. address vs value
- registers do not have types ‚ùó
- a register can hold any 32-bit number
  - the no has no implicit data type and is interpreted according to the instruction that uses it (weakly-typed)
2. byte vs word
- consecutive word addresses in machines with byte-addressing do not differ by 1
- common error: assume that the address of the next word can be found by incrementing the address in a register by 1 instead of the word size in bytes
- for both lw and sw: the sum of base address and offset must be a multiple of 4 (i.e. adhere to word boundary)
